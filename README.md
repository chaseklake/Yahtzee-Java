# Yahtzee-Java
Practicing my Java skills by programming a simple Yahtzee game for the console.

## Objects:
[Main] is where the functions for the game are held. <br>
[Dice] is a dice object that extends Thread to allow for rolling many dice at once using threadpools.

## TODO:
Finish implementing selectKeep() in Main to allow the user to select which dice they wish to keep.
